Could extend the example that puts random circles on the canvas
- It could have 1 ball the moves around and basically "eats" anything it collides with
- A pacman like effect on the circles
- This would demonstrate addition and removal from the quad tree
- As more and more elements get added to the QuadTree the pacman item could move quicker to try and eliminate more items that are being added

- Add example with "attractor" nodes, these behave similarly to how a black hole would.
    - Pull in nearby elements
    - Force field of each node is limited, get's stronger as more nodes are contained
- User can select or click where "attractor" nodes are placed.
