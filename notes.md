Could extend the example that puts random circles on the canvas
- It could have 1 ball the moves around and basically "eats" anything it collides with
- A pacman like effect on the circles
- This would demonstrate addition and removal from the quad tree
- As more and more elements get added to the QuadTree the pacman item could move quicker to try and eliminate more items that are being added
